# Inventory Notifier App

This is a Django app built for the Shopify App Store. Merchants in Shopify have the concept of product inventory. It is often helpful to know when a product's inventory is below a certain amount. This app calls or texts the Shopify merchant when any product's inventory goes below 10 items.

## Tools
Django, Twilio API, Shopify API.

I found this tutorial to set up Shopify for Django really helpful in building my app - http://gavinballard.com/shopify-app-in-15-minutes-with-django/.
